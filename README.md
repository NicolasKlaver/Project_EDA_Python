# Project_EDA_Python

In this project I make a Introductory analysis of the Movies dataset. 

The first approach is to do Data Cleaning and then see the correlation between the columns, particulary we are gonna to analyse the Gross column.
And finally leave some topics that may be interesting to review in the future and make a more complete project


#### Libraries used: 
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.


#### Skills used: 
- Data Cleaning and Data Visualization.
